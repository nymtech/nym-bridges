The nym-bridge is an open source system for establishing pluggable transport
connections to be used for wrapping and obfuscating VPN traffic. This is
meant to be deployed alongside the nym-node gateway in the entry capacity.

The larger Nym system provides a secure distributed multi-hop VPN and mixnet.

This package contains the nym-bridge daemon and bridge-cfg CLI binaries.
